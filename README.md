# File-Hasher

## ðŸ“Œ Description

File Hasher Analyzer is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for computing cryptographic file hashes. It supports multiple hashing algorithms, including **MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, SHA-3, and BLAKE2**, enabling verification of file integrity and authenticity. This software is ideal for **developers, security specialists, and IT administrators** who need to quickly compare files or verify their digital fingerprint.

Currently, the program is available in **Slovak**, but I plan to add **English language support** in the next version.
